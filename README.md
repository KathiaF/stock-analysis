# stock-analysis.
Module 2. VBA
## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve analize a data set of green energy stocks from the years 2017 and 2018, as his parents are interested in investing their money in a company DAQO New Energy Corp. Steve promised to look into DAQO stock along with several other companies for his parents. In order to assist Steve, a VBA script was developed in Excel to analyse the data set and provide the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. 

Steve loved the first macro that was created, and in the future he is planning to perform the analysis on larger data sets, therefore, It was decided to refactor the script to see if it is possible to reduce the processing time.

## Results
### Analysis of stocks

Both sets of data contained 3012 rows of raw data which were processed, and 12 tickers which were summarized.



### VBA Performance (Refactor VBA code)


## Summary
Code refactoring is the process of restructuring the original script without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and implementation of the code while preserving its functionality.

### Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general
- Advantages
  -  Improved code readability 
  -  Improved source-code maintenance and scalability
  -  It makes code easier to understand
    
- Disadvantages  
  - Invest time in developing it
  - Chance of mistakes 
  - It's risky when developers do not understand what's all about
