# stock-analysis.
Module 2. VBA
##Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve analize a data set of green energy stocks from the years 2017 and 2018, as his parents are interested in investing their money in a company DAQO New Energy Corp. Steve promised to look into DAQO stock along with several other companies for his parents. In order to assist Steve, a VBA script was developed in Excel to analyse the data set and provide the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. 

Steve loved the first macro that was created, and in the future he is planning to perform the analysis on larger data sets, therefore, It was decided to refactor the script to see if it is possible to reduce the processing time.

##Results
The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
